# CORNN - Continuous Optimisation of Regression tasks using Neural Networks

CORNN is easy to native python 3 benchmark suit. 

Problem instances are generated from 54 real-valued functions which form the basis of 324 nueral network regression tasks. Network architectures with different numbers of neurons generate problem instances with dimensions ranging from 41 to 481.
